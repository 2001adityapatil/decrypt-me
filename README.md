# Project Details

The application consists of three puzzles, and each puzzle has two clues provided in the navigation bar. The puzzles themselves are based on a poem or paragraph, and the user needs to use the information given to find the answer. The answer may be a keyword or a phrase that needs to be inputted into an input box. If the answer is correct, the user can move on to the next puzzle. However, if the answer is incorrect, the user cannot open the next puzzle, and a completed puzzle cannot be opened again.

To implement this i have created a node.js application that uses a web framework like Express.js to handle routing and rendering of the web pages. You can also use a database to store the user account information and the progress of the user in solving the puzzles.
